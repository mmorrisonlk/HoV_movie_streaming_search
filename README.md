This streaming search website was created in Javascript with the assitance of Jquery, the movie DB API and the Watchmode API. The styling was done with Materialize assisting basic CSS.

The goal of the app was to address the following situation:
    As someone who is looking for a movie to watch,
    I want to quickly find where the movie is streaming so
    I waste less time finding something to watch.
